          Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995. It is owned
          by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java. It is used for:
          <li>Mobile applications (specially Android apps)</li>
          <li>Desktop Applications</li>
          <li>Web Applications</li>
          <li>Games</li>
          <li>Database Connections and much more..</li>
        </p>

          Here is a code for adding two numbers:
          <pre class="language-java">
            import java.util.Scanner; // Import the Scanner class class MyClass
            { public static void main(String[] args) { int x, y, sum; Scanner
            myObj = new Scanner(System.in); // Create a Scanner object
            System.out.println("Type a number:"); x = myObj.nextInt(); // Read
            user input System.out.println("Type another number:"); y =
            myObj.nextInt(); // Read user input sum = x + y; // Calculate the
            sum of x + y System.out.println("Sum is: " + sum); // Print the sum
            } }
          </pre>
        </p>
        <pre class="language-javascript">
          function helloWorld() {
            console.log('Hello, world!');
          }
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          Variables are containers for storing data values. In Java, there are
          different types of variables, for example:
          <li>
            String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded
            by double quotes
          </li>
          <li>
            int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123
            or -123
          </li>
          <li>
            float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99
            or -19.99
          </li>
          <li>
            char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are
            surrounded by single quotes
          </li>
          <li>boolean - stores values with two states: true or false</li>
        </p>
        <code>String name = "John"; System.out.println(name);</code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="For-loop">
        <header>For-loop</header>
        <p>
          When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block
          of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop:
        </p>
        <code>
          for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) { // code block to be
          executed } for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { System.out.println(i); }
        </code>
        <p>
          Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code
          block. Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
          Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been
          executed.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Methods">
        <header>Methods</header>
        <p>
          A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can
          pass data, known as parameters, into a method. Methods are used to
          perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions. Why use
          methods? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.
        </p>
        <p>
          A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name
          of the method, followed by parentheses (). Java provides some
          pre-defined methods, such as System.out.println(), but you can also
          create your own methods to perform certain actions:
        </p>
        <code>
          public class Main { static void myMethod() { // code to be executed }
          }</code
        >
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Recursion">
        <header>Recursion</header>
        <p>
          Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This
          technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into
          simple problems which are easier to solve. Recursion may be a bit
          difficult to understand. The best way to figure out how it works is to
          experiment with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adding two numbers together is easy to do, but adding a range of
          numbers is more complicated. In the following example, recursion is
          used to add a range of numbers together by breaking it down into the
          simple task of adding two numbers:
          <code>
            public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { int
            result = sum(10); System.out.println(result); } public static int
            sum(int k) { if (k > 0) { return k + sum(k - 1); } else { return 0;
            } } }</code
